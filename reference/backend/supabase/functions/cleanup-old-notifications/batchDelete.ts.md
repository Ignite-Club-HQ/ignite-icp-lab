/**
 * Bounded, rerunnable batch deletion used by the daily cleanup function.
 *
 * Batching notes (fixed 2026-09-02):
 * - PostgREST caps a SELECT at 1000 rows by default, so the old BATCH_SIZE of
 *   2000 meant `rows.length < BATCH_SIZE` was true on the very first pass and
 *   the loop exited after a single batch. BATCH_SIZE is now 500, safely under
 *   the server cap, and termination no longer relies on a short read: the loop
 *   ends only when a batch returns zero rows, a delete fails, or the safety
 *   caps below are hit.
 * - Each batch is its own statement, so there is never one giant transaction.
 * - Bounded work per invocation (MAX_BATCHES_PER_TARGET / MAX_RUNTIME_MS)
 *   guarantees termination and keeps the function inside its wall-clock budget.
 * - Deletes are keyed by id with the same cutoff predicate re-applied, so
 *   repeated runs are idempotent: rows already gone simply aren't selected.
 *
 * Extracted from index.ts so the loop can be unit tested without booting a
 * Deno HTTP server.

 * Request" (observed live in DEV with the previous 2000-id deletes). Each batch
 * is therefore deleted in sub-chunks small enough to keep the URL well inside
 * that limit: 100 uuids is roughly 4 KB.
